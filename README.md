# Particle_system

A very simple and basic particle system made with the 2D rendering library Pygame and my little framework Laylib for rapid prototyping games.
Note: This application uses an obsolete version of Laylib, to launch it, use the laylib version that comes with in the same folder. If you have a recent version of laylib installed. Use a vienv too.
